Deployment
==========

There are a number of methods for deploying Django based applications Currently
the recommended deployment method is WSGI.

.. seealso::
 `<http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/>`_

Getting started
---------------

See the :file:`INSTALL` file for a list of package requirements
for Ubuntu/Debian, or use the supplied :file:`requirements.txt`
file to setup the dependencies using `pip <http://pip.openplans.org/>`_.

#. Checkout the code.

   * You might want to place the scripts outside the htdocs folder, e.g. /srv/www/timeplan
   * If scripts are placed outside htdocs, the :file:`timeplan/media` folder
     needs to be symlinked, e.g. :file:`/srv/www/htdocs/timeplan/media` â†’ 
     :file:`/srv/www/timeplan/media` or made available using the alias
     directive in Apache.

#. Necessary externals will need to be instaled using :command:`pip`.
#. Setup apache by following `Example Apache config`_ and reload apache.
#. Check `<www.example.com/timeplan/media/css/style.css>`_ to ensure that
   media is setup correctly
#. Setup `local configuration` (:file:`plan/settings/local.py`)
#. Create the database ``./manage.py syncdb``

   * Alternatively use ``./manage.py sqlall auth sites admin sessions
     contenttypes common`` to generate the SQL statements needed to create the
     database manually

#. Perform the required database migrations ``./manage.py migrate``
#. Create compressed media files ``./manage.py synccompress``

   * This needs to be done whenever the CSS or JS files for the site change
   * Any caches (memcached etc.) will need to be flushed as the cached data
     will point to removed files
   * Memcache flushing: ``echo "flush_all" | nc localhost 11211`` or restart
     memcached.

#. Touch :file:`wsgi/plan.wsgi` to reload the process
#. Check `www.example.com/timeplan/` and the main page should appear

   * If this doesn't work check the vhost's error-log and/or the apache
     error-log for hints about what is wrong

#. Disable debug mode: open :file:`settings/local.py` and add ``DEBUG = False``

Upgrading
---------

For a regular install that is already using :command:`south` the following should
suffice for upgrading to a newer version:

#. Backup your database (and optionally your install).
#. Retrieve the new version from VCS or tar-ball.
#. Check that :file:`requirements.txt` dependencies are met, if you are using
   :command:`virtualenv` and :command:`pip` simply running
   ``pip install -E path/to/virtualenv/dir -r requirements.txt`` should
   suffice.
#. Run ``./manage.py migrate`` to perform any database migrations.
#. Run ``./manage.py synccompress`` to compress any new JS and/or CSS.
#. Run ``touch ../wsgi/plan.wsgi`` to reload the application or restart Apache.
#. Note that you might have to flush your cache for changes to become visible.

.. important::
  If the install hasn't been using :command:`south` the following needs to run to get
  the system in the correct state. As of version ``1.3`` all plan installs are
  expected to use south for migrations.

  * ``1.0`` users need to run ``./manage.py migrate common 0001 --skip`` first
  * ``1.1`` users need to run ``./manage.py migrate common 0035 --skip`` first
  * ``1.2`` users need to run ``./manage.py migrate common 0038 --skip`` first

Additional setup
----------------

If using the `Django admin site
<http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/>`_ , media files
should be available from the directory given in :file:`plan/settings/local.py`
``ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX = '/timeplan/media/admin'``.

- From checkout path, create a symlinked folder: ``ln -s
  /usr/share/python-support/python-django/django/contrib/admin/media
  media/admin`` **OR**
- Add an alias to Apache config: ``Alias /timeplan/media/admin/
  /usr/share/python-support/python-django/django/contrib/admin/media``

Example local.py
----------------

Using the default settings file gives you reasonable sensible settings for
development which rely on a local SQLite database for storage. To allow for
local configuration of the site add a file :file:`plan/settings/local.py`.
This is the file where the settings specific to your site should be kept, this
file should not be checked in to any VCS and is where the software will end up
getting the database credentials.


::

    DEBUG = True
    TEMPLATE_DEBUG = DEBUG

    ADMINS = (
        ('<Your name here>', '<your email here>'),
    )
    MANAGERS = ADMINS

    # Make this unique, and don't share it with anybody.
    SECRET_KEY = '<Your nice long secret key here>'

    DATABASE_ENGINE = 'mysql' # See Django docs...
    DATABASE_NAME = '<Your db name here>'
    DATABASE_USER = '<Your db user here>'
    DATABASE_HOST = '<Your db host here>'
    DATABASE_PASSWORD = '<Your db password here>'
    DATABASE_OPTIONS = { # Only needed for mySQL
       "init_command": "SET storage_engine=INNODB",
    }

    # This extra set of settings is to connect to
    # the NTNU lecture database.
    MYSQL_NAME = ''
    MYSQL_USER = ''
    MYSQL_PASSWORD = ''
    MYSQL_HOST = ''

    CACHE_BACKEND = 'locmen://' # See Django docs...
    CACHE_PREFIX = '<Your prefix here>' # Should be unique per site

    # Web URL where Django should expect to find media files
    MEDIA_URL = '/timeplan/media/'
    ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX = '/timeplan/media/admin/'

    # Hostname to be used in UID of ical events, should be a constant service-name
    # as UID changes will trigger email notices for new events in some cases.
    ICAL_HOSTNAME = '<Your service DNS name here>'

    # Where the software can be downloaded as required by the AGPL
    SOURCE_URL = 'https://github.com/adamcik/plan'

Remember to set ``DEBUG = False`` on all production setups.

Example Apache config
---------------------

::

    RewriteEngine On
    # Add trailing slash
    RewriteRule ^/timeplan$ /timeplan/ [R=permanent,L]

    WSGIScriptAlias /timeplan /path/to/checkout/timeplan/wsgi/plan.wsgi

    Alias /timeplan/media  /path/to/checkout/htdocs/timeplan/media

    <Location /timeplan/media>
        SetHandler None

        # If DEFLATE is already turned on globally this is not needed.
        AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css application/x-javascript
    </Location>

.. _proxy:

Behind a reverse proxy
----------------------

To setup the application behind a proxy using mod_proxy, the following
configuration is needed on the frontend server:

::

    <Proxy *> # Enable proxy for vhost
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Proxy>

    ProxyRequests Off # Turn of forward proxy

    # Setup reverse-proxy
    ProxyPass /timeplan/ http://backend.server.com/timeplan/
    ProxyPassReverse /timeplan/ http://backend.server.com/timeplan/

If the app is located at the same URL on both frontend and backend everything
should work fine from here on.

If the backend has the app setup at ``/`` and the frontend at ``/timeplan/``
simply add the following :file:`plan/settings/local.py`

::

    FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME = '/timeplan/'
